###About
Experimental HTML5 canvas game intended to subtly teach basic equation balancing.  Choose which side has more particles in it.  Starts off very simple, but later involves dealing with negative values and transferring particles from one side to the other.  As well as fractional values and values greater than one.  Particles can combine, and their number of stripes indicates value.  All actions maintain the inequality so that the answer of which side is greater is always the same.  Every level has slightly different mechanics and a different procedurally generated background.

###Instructions
Select which side is greater than the other.  You must get at least a bronze star to unlock the next level.  51 Levels in all, good luck, and I hope you enjoy playing.  As a super difficult challenge, try to get gold star on every level.

###Browsers
Should work in all major browsers, but for best performance use chrome.  Also works on mobile browsers although there seem to be some canvas rendering issues still.  Some of the later levels may run slowly on lower end computers.
